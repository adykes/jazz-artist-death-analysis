This folder holds all the data on the jazz bassists that I have scraped from Wikipedia

A note on the classification of instrument: I have made "Upright bass" the default for every double-bass, acoustic bass, and upright bass player. This is kind of a 
trivial distinction, so if anyone has arguments against this classification, I'd be glad to hear them. Other than that, "Electric bass" is the second most frequent 
classification. There are a couple of other bass instruments sprinkled in, but I felt like they were different enough from a bass to warrant their own categories.
