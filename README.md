# jazz-artist-web-scraper

This project is a webscraping, data cleaning, and data analysis project on basic biographical information about jazz musicians. 
As a listener and musician of jazz and its related / descendant styles, I've always been fascinated with the lives of jazz musicians 
and how we understand jazz culture now, in the 21st century. A popular stereotype about jazz musicians that is often circulated is
that jazz musicians overwhelmingly die from either drug overdoses or the direct effects of lifetimes of drug abuse. To investigate this, 
I have thought up this project. The main purpose of this project is to collect basic biographical data on jazz musicians (most importantly
their lifespans) and run some basic analysis on the data to extract trends that may or may not support the above thesis about the 
lifestyles of jazz musicians. 

As of the time of writing (9/24/20), I've only completed collecting and cleaning the data on jazz pianists. I will keep a separate file 
in this repository that will show the progress I make over time. I will also update this document with technical details as I clarify some
of the processes and methods that I use for this project. 

**General Process**: 

First, I am going to scrape the pages of lists of jazz musicians from Wikipedia for basic biographical data. For now, these pages are:
